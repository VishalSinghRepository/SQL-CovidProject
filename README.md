# COVID SQL Portfolio Project  

This project explores COVID-19 datasets (deaths, vaccinations) and transforms raw CSV files into structured SQL tables in MySQL Workbench.  

## Features  
- Designed relational tables (`coviddeaths` & `covidvaccinations`)  
- Imported 85K+ rows of raw data using `LOAD DATA INFILE`, handling empty values with `NULLIF()`  
- Built queries to analyze:  
  - 📈 Infection & death rates by country/continent  
  - 🌍 Global trends over time  
  - 💉 Vaccination progress & population coverage  
- Implemented CTEs, temporary tables, and views for reusability and clarity  

## Skills Demonstrated  
- Data Cleaning & Transformation in SQL  
- Analytical SQL (Window Functions, Aggregations, Joins)  
- Schema Design & Performance Optimization  

## Next Steps  
Connect database with Power BI / Tableau for interactive dashboards.
